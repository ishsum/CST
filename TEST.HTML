 At Chitkara University, our Engineering students receive a quality education that prepares them to advance the 
 frontiers of technology  Through our “Hands-on” curriculum, 
 students design and construct all-terrain vehicles; design, 
 build and </SPAN> load steel bridges; produce computer animations 
 and video games; and harness the power of the sun to race 
 cars that they design, build and test. Our engineers don’t
 just learn theory – they expand upon it and apply it.
 Chitkara Engineering programs were initiated in the year 
 2002 with the sole focus to prepare students from all
 backgrounds for careers as Engineering in a rapidly changing, 
 technology-driven society. Within a decade, our Engineering 
 (B.tech) programs have emerged as among the top 50 of the country
 which speaks volumes about our strong academic heritage,
 innovative teaching methodology, and proactive industry collaborations</B>
