<H2> UNHEARD CRIES </H2>
<P>
HE SAID HE LOVED<BR>
WHY HE CANT REMAIN WHITOUT BEING TOUCHED<BR>
HE SAID HE CARED<BR>
WHERE WAS HE WHEN I WAS SCARED<BR>
HE SAID HE WANNA MARRY<BR>
WHY CANT HE SEE THE PAIN I CARRY<BR>
HE SAID HE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT ME<BR>
I COULD NOT FIND YOU WHEN HE ABUSED ME<BR>
HE SAID HE CAN FEED<BR>
I ASKED WHY SHOULD I PLEAD<BR>
HE SAID HE LOVED<BR>
AND I BLAMED MY DESTINY<BR> 
HE CANT EVEN RELEIVE MY AGONY<BR>
HE SAID HE WILL TRY<BR>
WHY MY SLEEPS WERE DISTURBED WITH THE CRY<BR>
HE SAID HE LOVED.<BR>
